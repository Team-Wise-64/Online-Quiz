# Online-Quiz 

This is an interactive online quiz where players can create an account and score high to win a spot on the leaderboard!

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `quiz-frontend/` folder in a terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd quiz-frontend/ 
   ```

2. Install the dependencies and seed the initial data:
   ```bash
   npm install --force
   npm run seed
   ```

### Running

To run the application, you will need two separate terminals to run the back-end and front-end.

#### Back-end

1. Open an IDE or equivalent and navigate to the `quiz-backend` folder.

2. Run the `QuizBackendApplication` class in your IDE. It can be found at:
   ```
   quiz-backend/src/main/java/QuizBackendApplication
   ```
   This will start the back-end server.

#### Front-end

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `quiz-frontend` directory.
   ```bash
   cd quiz-frontend/
   ```

2. Run the following command to start the front-end React application:
   ```bash
   npm run client-dev
   ```

   This will start the front-end development server.

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application. The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
