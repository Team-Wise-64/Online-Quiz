# Online-Quiz

This is a interactive online quiz where players can create an account and score high to win a spot on the leaderboard!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

1) Clone the repo and cd into the folder quiz-frontend/ in a terminal and run:
```
npm install --force
npm run seed
```



### Running

You will have to have two terminals to run the back-end and front-end
1) First use an IDE or equivalent to open the quiz-backend folder and run the Class QuizBackendApplication in IntelliJ found in 
```
quiz-backend/src/main/java/QuizBackendApplication
```
Once the server backend is running you can cd into quiz-frontend/ and run 
```
npm run client-dev
```
This will run the front-end react and the quiz is running!
